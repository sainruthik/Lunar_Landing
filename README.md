# Lunar Lander Simulation with Reinforcement Learning
## Project Overview

The **Lunar Lander Simulation** project showcases a reinforcement learning agent trained to control a lunar lander. The goal is to land safely while minimizing fuel usage and controlling the lander under various conditions. We employ OpenAI Gym's `LunarLander-v3` environment and reinforcement learning methods to achieve optimal performance.

In this repository, you will find:
- **Simulation Code**: Full implementation of the agent and environment setup.
- **Pretrained Models**: Checkpoints of trained agents.
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Scripts to evaluate and visualize the agent's performance.
